BGP setup on router:

conf t
router bgp 10  - 10 is the number of routers autonomous system
network 1.1.1.1 mask 255.255.255.0  - local network that will be advertised
neighbor 10.0.1.2 remote-as 20  - ip of neighbor router from autonomous system 20

Set up BGP with ospf. Routes will be advertised only FROM local network.
That means packages will be received only TO local network:

conf t
router bgp 10
redistribute ospf 200
exit
exit

Set up default gateway on local network router that is connected to the other world through another router:

conf t
ip default-network 30.0.0.0
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 30.0.0.1  - ip address of router through which we connect to the world


Task solution:

- Set up ip and default gateway on PCs. E.g. for PC-1:

ip 1.0.0.2/24 1.0.0.1
save
